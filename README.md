# Ex6_Spam_Classifier_SVM

This programming exercise was done as part of Coursera's Machine Learning Course (Stanford University), taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.

* Built a spam classifier for emails using Support Vector Machines
* Preprocessed and normalized emails in the dataset
* Implemented feature extraction to generate a feature vector for each email 
* Trained the SVM for spam classification using a simplified version of the SMO (sequential minimal optimization) algorithm and computed training and test accuracy
